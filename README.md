Text Mining Program for Emails

The Unravel program analyzes the relationship and personality of individuals based on the emails they send. It considers both the content and the traffic of the email. It deploys text preprocessing and Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to determine the topics of the emails. It also aggregates emails between pairs of individuals and mines their relationship based on the topic model. It constructs a network to visualize the interpersonal relationships

The program is tested on the email traffic data provided by Enron. It is able to discover several import social hubs in the Enron employees and their distinct personalities and connections.
